# CSS with web.dev

Taking a deeper dive into CSS with web.dev

So far I have learnt CSS largely by experimentation. I am diving into web.dev's material in order to gain a deeper understanding of the language, to be better grounded, adopt solid principles and best practices from Google and to better develop my mental framework around using the language.

## Box Model
Everything in CSS is contained in a box! Intrinsic vs Extrinsic sizing can affect the way content is displayed. Extrinsic content works for content of a fixed size but dynamic content works better with intrinsic sizing so that the box container adjusts as the content changes.
